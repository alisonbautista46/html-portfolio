<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As an advocate for environmental justice and community empowerment, I bring a unique blend of skills and experience to my geospatial analysis, data storytelling, and product management work. 
  With a passion for making data accessible to diverse audiences, I strive to bridge the gap between science and community through visual products that inform and inspire action. 
  I reimagine ways we can approach environmental injustices as a wider community, and I spend my free time with my hands in the dirt caring for community gardens and plants.</p>
